LEVELDB_MCPE INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR LINUX SYSTEMS
========================================================

In order to install this library, you will run the 'setup.py' file.

An alternative beta file 'setupnx.py' is also provided. It will try to
solve the binary and library dependencies for you, provided you have
them installed on your system. These dependencies are the same as for
the 'setup.py' script.

Since the library is compiled against Boost, Mojang's leveldb-mcpe and
Python 2.7, you will need these dependencies.

Ensure you're connected to internet. Somes packages need to be
downloaded.

DEPENDENCIES
~~~~~~~~~~~~

BINARIES
~~~~~~~~

These binaries/tools have to be installed on system in order to compile
leveldb_mcpe:

* g++
* make
* tar
* unzip


BOOST 1.55.0 STATIC BOOST_PYTHON
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Boost 1.55.0 static boost_python is needed to compile leveldb_mcpe.
This specific build will be installed automatically (if not found) for
the user only. This mean that, if '~/.local/lib/boost_1_55_0_mcpe' is
not found, Boost will be installed there.

You have nothing to do.

If you run again the setup.py script, and Boost is found, it won't be
reinstalled.


MOJANG'S LEVELDB-MCPE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Like Boost, this library will be installed if not found.
It will be installed in '~/.local/lib/leveldb-mcpe'.


PYTHON 2.7 HEADERS AND DEV PACKAGE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unfortunately, no solution to build Boost and leveldb_mcpe against a
user specific install of Python headers and devolopment package was
found (for now).

You'll have to install them on you system with you package manager...


~~~~~~~~~~~~
INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Just run 'python setup.py build' et voil√†!
